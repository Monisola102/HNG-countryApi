# Country Currency & Exchange API  
A RESTful backend built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize that fetches country data, stores it in MySQL, and generates a GDP summary image using Sharp.  

## Setup  
Run `npm install`, create a `.env` file for DB config, then start the server with `npm start`.  
Test endpoints like `/api/countries/refresh` and `/api/countries/image` using Postman or your browser.
